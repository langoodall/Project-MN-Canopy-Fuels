# Project-MN-Canopy-Fuels
### Still a work in progress 
Project to investigate the canopy fuels of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota. Using a mixture of GEDI plot data, LANDFIRE rasters and remotely sensed Sentinel-2 data (among others), I will use machine learning to ultimately create a map canopy fuel loads in the BWCA.
