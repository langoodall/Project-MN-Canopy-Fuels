### Overview
This projects leverages GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) data and other remote sensing datasets to develop a high-resolution map of canopy fuel loads and wildfire susceptibility in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) of northern Minnesota.

### Project Status
This project is currently processing the remotely sensed data. The final step in the project will be to use universal kriging to create a complete map of canopy fuels in the Boundary Waters.

### Objectives
Acquire and process GEDI L2A data ✅
Determine GEDI footrpint-level canopy fuel metrics ✅
Integrate auxillary datasets via Google Earth Engine (LANDFIRE, Sentinel-1 / 2, MODIS) ✅
Use kriging to create a wall to wall map of canopy fuels
